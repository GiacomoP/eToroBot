## Requirements
- Python 3.7
- An eToro account **without** the two-factor authentication enabled (not supported yet).
- Xignite API credentials

## Installation
- `git clone git@github.com:GiacomoP/eToroBot.git`
- `cd eToroBot`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

After you've installed the required modules:
- `mkdir bin`
- Download [chromedriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/) and put the binary file in the `bin` folder just created.
- Create an `.env` file based on `.example.env`
- Run `python main.py`

You can create a cron job that runs main.py every time you'd like to publish a status message.

The code has been tested with ChromeDriver 75.0.3770.90, and also with [PhantomJS 2.1.1](https://phantomjs.org/download.html) even though it's deprecated in the chosen version of Selenium. Other web drivers might work, too.

## Working example
Feel free to follow me at https://www.etoro.com/people/jackheuston to see a working example with stocks from the London Stock Exchange!

## Caveats
I've filled `settings.py` with all the stocks I could find in eToro via some network requests scraping. However, some of those stocks don't seem to actually be in eToro and tagging them in the status message with `$STK_NAME` won't work.

I'll remove them from the list as soon as I detect them all. You're also free to open a pull request.
